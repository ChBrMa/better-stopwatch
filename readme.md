### This is a module for time measurement in your Rust code

## **Warning:**

## This project is not yet ready to be used as it is just in early development

**Important:**

This is a rework of the original crate [Stopwatch](https://crates.io/crates/stopwatch) because it is no longer maintained for about 6 years. Therefore I will revise Stopwatch and continue with new features as better-stopwatch.
